# 🎡 Welcome to Luna Park

[Luna Park](https://luna-park.app) is a visual scripting editor for the web. Faster and easier than code, more flexible and performant than no-code, visual scripting makes software development accessible to anyone.

You can try out the editor on the [Luna Park website](https://luna-park.app). If you want to learn how to use visual scripting, you can take up the [Luna Park challenge](https://luna-park.app/challenge), a series of puzzle that will teach you the basics in a gamified way.

### 🏗️ Editor Setup

Luna Park is made to be integrated in any web stack. You can check out some boilerplate examples in the [lunapark/demo repo](https://github.com/lunapark/demo). 

To learn how to create custom JS nodes, compile logics to JS or execute the logic from a JS context, please refer to the Luna Park documentation available here: https://luna-park.app/documentation.
